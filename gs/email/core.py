                   become the from-address on the *envelope;* it is

                   :mailheader:`Sender`, and :mailheader:`Reply-to`
                   addresses in the email message.
:param recipients: The address of the person who should receive the email
                   message, a ``list`` of recipients, or a ``tuple``
                   containing the addresses of the recipients. This will
                   become the  to-address on the  *envelope;* it is separate
                   from the To, CC, and BCC addresses in the email message.
:type recipients: ``str``, ``tuple``, or ``list``.
:param str email: The email message, as a string. It needs to be a complete
                  message with headers and a body.
:returns: ``None``.

The :func:`send_email` function uses SMTP to send an  :param:`email` message
to the :param:`recipients` in *batches*. The batching is necessary to
prevent overwhelming the SMTP server (it makes management of the mail queue
easier).
